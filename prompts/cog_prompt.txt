"The conversation has ended, evaluate the person you spoke to based on the following criteria: 
1. Inattention: Does the patient have difficulty in focusing attention (for example, is he or she easily distracted) or in keeping track of what is being said?
2. Disorganised thinking: Is the patient’s speech disorganised or incoherent, such as rambling or irrelevant conversation, unclear or illogical 
flow of ideas, or unpredictable switching from subject to subject?
3. Altered level of consciousness: Overall, how would you rate this patient’s level of consciousness? Alert (normal), vigilant (hyperalert),
lethargic (drowsy, easily aroused), stupor (difficult to arouse), coma (unarousable). Any rating other than “alert” is scored as abnormal.
